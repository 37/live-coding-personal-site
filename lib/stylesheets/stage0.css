 * Hey stranger,
 *
 * My name is Keaton Okkonen and I'm a developer entrepreneur based out of Melbourne, Australia.
 *
 * I'm a competition coder (read: slightly insane and likes a challenge too much)
 *
 * who likes hiphop and making stuff.
 *
 * You're either:
 *
 * A) wanting to see my resume
 *
 * or
 *
 * B) just wanting to see something cool
 *
 * so let's kill two birds with one *cough* site, and build a CV on the fly.
 *
 * First let me tidy up the workspace..
