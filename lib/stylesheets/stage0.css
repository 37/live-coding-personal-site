 * Hey stranger,
 *
 * My name is Keaton Okkonen and I'm a developer entrepreneur based out of Melbourne, Australia.
 *
 * I'm a competition coder (read: slightly insane and likes a challenge too much),
 *
 * who likes a good beer and burger,
 *
 * hiphop & rap music (though I'll listen to anything),
 *
 * asking questions that start with 'what if' and 'why',
 *
 * and the Oxford comma.
 *
 * You're probably here to see my resume or just something rad so lets build one on the fly!
 *
 * First let me tidy up the workspace..
